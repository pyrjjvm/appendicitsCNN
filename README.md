*A PyTorch project for binary classification of grayscale ultrasound images using a pretrained ResNet50 backbone.*

## üìö Overview

This project implements a **transfer learning pipeline** for binary classification of grayscale ultrasound images:

* **ResNet50 Backbone** pretrained on ImageNet
* **Frozen backbone initially** to prevent overfitting on small datasets
* **BCEWithLogitsLoss** for stable binary classification
* **Learning rate scheduler** for smooth convergence

Ideal for researchers and developers working with **small medical imaging datasets**.

## üß† Dataset

This project utilizes the **Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset**, which was acquired in a retrospective study from a cohort of pediatric patients admitted with abdominal pain to Children‚Äôs Hospital St. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. The dataset includes:

* **Multiple abdominal B-mode ultrasound images** for most patients
* **Tabular data** comprising laboratory tests, physical examination results, clinical scores (e.g., Alvarado and pediatric appendicitis scores), and expert-produced ultrasonographic findings
* **Three target variables**: diagnosis (appendicitis vs. no appendicitis), management (surgical vs. conservative), and severity (complicated vs. uncomplicated or no appendicitis)

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Regensburg (no. 18-1063-101, 18-1063\_1-101, and 18-1063\_2-101) and was performed following applicable guidelines and regulations. ([Zenodo][1])
